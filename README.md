# Social Media Project

This project will incorporate the design and implementation of an application that maintains the data for a simple social media network.

### Criteria:

1. Each person in the network will have a profile
2. Each profile will have a name, an image, current status, and a list of friends

3. The applcation will allow the user to join the network, leave the network, create a profile, modify the profile, search for other profiles, and add or remove friends

4. This project will not use imported data structures, only those I have written before

### Design Idea:

The Data structures I will be using will be a List and a Dictionary

- Create: Add profile - Add friends
- Read: Read the information of a profile - Search for other profiles
- Update: Update and edit the profile - Update the friends list
- Delete: Delete a profile - Delete a friend of a profile

### Questions:
1. What data structures did you use and why
